            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973,
                    to a Rajapur Saraswat Brahmin Maharastrian family</li>
                <li>His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother, 
                    Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.
                    Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman.
                    Tendulkar also showed an interest in tennis that was on an equal level to cricket. He particularly idolised American player John McEnroe, and emulated his hero by growing his hair long at the age of 7 or 8 years. At this time, Tendulkar also regularly wore tennis wristbands and headbands, 
                    and carried a tennis racquet with him as a sign of his love for tennis</li>
                
                    <li>Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). 
                        As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.

            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>On 14 November 1987, the 14-year-old Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, India's premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season. However, he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches,
                     though he was often used as a substitute fielderHe narrowly missed out on playing alongside his idol Gavaskar,
                      who had retired from all forms of cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.</li>
                <li> year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at Wankhede stadium and scored 100 not out in that match,
                     making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.</li>
                <li>He was selected to play for the team by the then Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after watching him easily playing India's best fast bowler at the time, Kapil Dev, in the Wankhede Stadium's Cricket practice nets,where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies,
                     which are also Indian domestic tournaments.</li>

            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. 
                    When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations. 
                    However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Azharuddin was credited with saying"Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!",
                    which translates into: "He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!".</li>
                <li>Tendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on a tour of Australia,
                     where the visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly crowned world champions.Tendulkar, however, won the player of the series award as well as player of the match in one of the games.After another Test series defeat, this time by a 0–2 margin at home against South Africa, 
                    Tendulkar resigned, and Sourav Ganguly took over as captain in 2000</li>
                <li>During the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, the desire of Rahul Dravid to resign from the captaincy became known. Then Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) President Sharad Pawar offered the 
                    captaincy to Tendulkar, who instead recommended Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take over the reins. Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for first forwarding the name of Dhoni, 
                    who since achieved much success as captain.</li>
